## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Manifest V3** - Uses the latest Chrome extension architecture
- **Service Worker** - Background script handles toolbar clicks
- **Content Script** - Runs on active tab to extract article content
- **Session Storage** - Passes extracted content to reader view

### Content Extraction

The extension uses **Mozilla Readability** - the same library powering Firefox Reader View. It:

- Analyzes the DOM structure
- Scores content blocks based on text density and patterns
- Extracts title, author, main content, and images
- Converts relative URLs to absolute URLs
- Handles lazy-loaded images

### Security

- **HTML Sanitization** - Removes scripts and event handlers
- **Minimal Permissions** - Uses `activeTab` for privacy
- **CSP Compliant** - No inline scripts or eval
- **Safe URL Handling** - Validates and converts URLs safely

## Customization

### Themes

Three built-in themes with carefully chosen color schemes:
- **Light** - Classic white background
- **Sepia** - Warm, paper-like appearance
- **Dark** - Easy on the eyes in low light

### Font Sizes

Five preset font sizes from 16px to 24px for comfortable reading.

### Content Width

Toggle between normal (720px) and wide (960px) layouts.

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome (Manifest V3)
- ✅ Edge (Chromium-based)
- ✅ Brave

## Known Limitations

- Won't work on Chrome internal pages (`chrome://`)
- May not extract content well from:
  - Heavily JavaScript-rendered single-page apps
  - Paywalled content
  - Non-article pages (forums, dashboards)
- Does not bypass paywalls (by design)

## Troubleshooting

**Extension doesn't extract content:**
- Ensure you're on a standard article/blog page
- Some sites use non-standard layouts that don't work well
- Try refreshing the page and clicking again

**Images not showing:**
- Some sites use complex lazy-loading that may not be captured
- Check your internet connection

**Preferences not saving:**
- Ensure Chrome sync is enabled
- Check extension permissions
